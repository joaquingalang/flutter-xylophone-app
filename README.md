# Flutter Xylophone App ðŸŽµ

A simple Xylophone app made with Flutter for a mobile development workshop led by Google Developer Groups on Campus - Holy Angel University.

The participants will replicate this application in a code-along lecture where they must demonstrate their understanding of functions and the different Flutter Widgets such as Rows, Columns, Expanded, etc.

The particpants will also be introduced to the [audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers) Flutter package from [pub.dev](pub.dev) and how it can be used to play audio files.

This was a challenge that I took when I was first studying Flutter from a Udemy course prepared by [AppBrewery](https://appbrewery.com/) and led by [Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/?srsltid=AfmBOoovfgC-L04PYv8VMl4nLfUwtTWxouMhmZM6bq-XJeawxFKFMoUh) titled [The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW).
